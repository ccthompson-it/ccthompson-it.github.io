      <h1>Margins, Borders and Padding</h1>

            Padding, border and margin are CSS elements that help give life to a web page. All of them relate to the content they are used on.
          </p>
          <p>
            Padding is used to push the border further away from the content. It is mostly useful for making objects bigger, such as buttons.
            Padding will not change the size of the content itself, although the area of the padding will be affected by some styles such 
            as background colour.
          </p>
          <p>
            The border element gives items borders. The thickness, colour and style of border can all be changed. A powerful way to create borders without
            actually using them is the "shadow" effect, which is used on the navigation bar and footer of this page.
          </p>
          <p>
            Margin can be used to push other parts of the page away from the content. Most spacing done on web pages (including this one)
            is done using margins.

            To look at it from a real world perspective, here is a detailed picture of my house. I live on a corner.
            In this context, the house is the "content", the backyard is the "padding", the fence is the "border", and the footpath is the "margin".
          </p>
          <p>
            The backyard gives the house space to breathe, and makes everything look less cramped. The fence stands as a physical border, defining the area that is mine.
            The footpath pushes my house away from the road.
