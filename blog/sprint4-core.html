      <h1>Neuroplasticity</h1>
      <p>
        Neuroplasticity is the way in which permanant learning takes place within the brain. It is the way that the neurons 
        in our brain connect and create pathways. Repeating activities strengthens pathways in our brain, making the connection 
        stronger and thus making it easier for the brain to do tasks. A good way to engage with neuroplasticity is to keep practicing.
        <br>
        For me, the main way will benefit me is through repetition of code. This will help me both with my tying and with the coding itself.
        The main way to increase neuroplasticity is just through repetitions. Doing something over and over will strengthen the pathways in your 
        brain and increase your proficience in the activity.

      <h1>Growth Mindset</h1>
      <p>
        When looking at how people learn, there are two mindsets. The fixed mindset, and the growth mindset. Someone with a fixed mindset 
        believes that they are limited to what they know. For example, someone struggling in school may have a fixed mindset if they believe
        they are not good at maths or english, and so there is no way they can do well. A growth mindset, on the other hand, is someone who 
        always believes they can be better. They are not put off my setbacks, and understand that hard work will take effort to complete.
        <br>
        Whilst this idea is not new to me, the task was more of a reminder of how the mindsets differ, and I learnt a lot more about the actual benefits 
        of a growth mindset. In the past, throughout school, I have always been at the top of the class. I never really had to try or put any effort in to 
        achieve this. Now, looking back, I have developed somewhat of a fixed mindset towards some things in life. As such, I will be looking for ways to 
        improve my mindset and put more effort into places that have been lacking it. I will look to not stop learning once I am above my peers, but when
        I have done all that I can.
