      <h1>Problem Solving</h1> 

      <h3>A Simple Problem, and an Elegant Solution</h3>
      <p>
        In maths, my teacher used to love doing prblem solving races, where he would get 20 questions off the internet, put us in group, and we would race to finish them all first. One time, the first question was find the next letter in the sequence "O T T F F". Our group had no idea, and sat there for about five minutes before realising the answer. The letters just stood for "One Two Three Four Five".

      <h3>Problem Solving Techniques</h3>
      <p>
        <i>Pseudocode:</i> I have had experience with and am confident in using pseudocode.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Try Something:</i> More of a last resort, although random guessing can help give you an idea of what the actual answer is.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Rubber Ducky Method:</i> I have always heard that saying the problem out loud is a good way to solve problems, but have never tried it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Reading Error Messages:</i> I normally use error messages to find where the problem is and get a general idea as to what the problem is.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Console.logging:</i> I have started doing this a lot more recently as it is a very good way to figure out what information is getting passed where.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Google:</i> Google holds all of the answers, although I tend to try and figure it out myself first.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Asking peers for help:</i> I am comfortable asking my peers for help, especially if I know I have made a small / silly mistake.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Asking coaches for help:</i> I am comfortable asking coaches for help, as this is one of the purposes of a coach.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Improving your process with reflection:</i> I have never been one to purposefuly reflect on processes, but rather subconsciously learn until it becomes habit.
