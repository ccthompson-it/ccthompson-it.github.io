      <h1>My Values</h1>
      <p>
        A situation where I had an ethical decision to make would be when I finished school at the end of this year. The two main choices I had were to go straight into university or to go into full time work.<br>
        Most of my friends were, or already had moved into full time work. On the other hand, most of the people in the same classes as me (physics, IT, graphic design etc...) were moving straight into university.<br>
        As such, I was torn. I was not sure if I wanted to go into work or to university. I wanted to do more study but did not want to spend another 3 or 4 years learning about subjects I was not interested in. <br>
        Eventually, I decided that I valued taking a break from study, using the time to zone out after so long focusing on schoolwork. During my break, I learnt about Dev Academy, and it fit in perfectly with when 
        I wanted to study, and how I wanted to study.

          My family has taught me respect and integrity. Throughout my life I have always had patience. I would always be the one to wait for others to go before me, and have never been the one to push others aside to get in sooner.
      </p>
      <p>
        My biggest strength has always been my problem solving ability. Throughout my life I have also been very good at picking up and learning new things. I have struggled in the past with focusing on things that do not interest me, as well as getting my ideas to others in a way that they can understand them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The strength that will help me the most will most likely be my problem solving ability as all of web development and coding is about running into obstacles and finding a way around them.  
      </p>
      <p>
        I have not had much experience working with others through tension or resistance, however from what I know of myself I would most likely have taken a back seat and let them take control, as I generally have no interest in taking charge.
