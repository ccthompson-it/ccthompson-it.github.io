        <h1>My Learning Plan</h1>
        <p>
            My long term goal at this stage is just to get into web development. I do not know yet whether I would prefer front end or back end development.
        </p>
        <p>
            The skill I would most like to get better at is sharing my ideas to others.
        </p>
        <p>
            I will manage my workload in this programme by making sure I am doing the work when it is assigned, not when it is due. I will also look to take a larger part in group chats, trying to help people where I can, especially since I know a lot about html and css already.
        </p>
        <p>
            When seeking help, I will look first to the slack group chat, to see if others are having the same problem or to ask if nobody has. If that does not work, I will send my facilitator a message directly.
        </p>
        <p>
            What I expect from the facilitation team is to check in weekly and make sure I understand the material.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have no commitments during the week besides study, but usually am busy on weekends with family and friends.
