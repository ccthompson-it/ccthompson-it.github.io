    <h1>Javascript, HTML and CSS</h1>
    <h2>HTML and CSS</h2>
    <p>When looking at how HTML and CSS work together, an analogy can be helpful. If they were parts of a house,
      HTML would be the walls, floor and ceiling. CSS would then be all the details, such as the carpet, wallpaper and furniture. <br>
      HTML is what gives web pages their basic structure, and CSS is used to make the pages look pretty.
    </p>
    <h2>Control Flow and Loops</h2>
    <P>In Code, the control flow is the order in which code is executed. The flow can be altered using conditional (if, if else) statements, loops and functions.
      Loops are snippets of code that will run multiple times until a condition has been met. The main loops used are the "for" loop and the "while" loop. <br>
      The "for" loop will repeat a piece of code a set number of times. In contrast, the "while" loop will rerun the code until a condition is met.

        <h2>The DOM</h2>
        <p>The DOM, or Document Object Module, represents the structure of HTML files. It can be visualised as a tree diagram and gives us an idea as to how 
          HTML pages are processed. <br>
          The Dom can be accessed through the developer tools of searh engines such as Chrome and Firefox, or more directly through the use JavaScript commands.
          For example, the classes of an element can be accessed by the command "getElementsByClassName".

    <h2>Accessing Data from Arrays and Objects</h2>
    <p>Arrays are generally used when listing lots of the same things, such as numbers in a lottery. This is because in order to get a specific value out of the 
      array, you must know what position it is in the array. For example, if you wanted the third value out of the array "lotteryNumbers", you would type "lotteryNumbers[2]".
      Two is used as opposed to three becasue computers count starting from zero (0, 1, 2 etc..).<br>
      An object, on the other hand, works more like a list of variables. Each object will have a list of properties, where each property is assigned a value. Specific data can 
      be accessed more easily just by asking for the property. For example, the object "player" could contain the properties health, strength and speed. In order to access the 
      health of the player, you would type "player.health". In this way, objects are more useful than lists as you do not need to know the exact order of info like in a list.
    </p>
    <h2>Functions</h2>
    <p>A function is a snippet of code that can be called to run at multiple places in a program. These functions can take in values from the main flow of code, and return values
      back to it. For example, a function could be created to add two numbers together. The function could then be called at any time two numbers needed to be added. The two numbers 
      would be passed into the funciton, the function would add the two numbers and then return the result back into the main flow. The main benefit of funtions is that they can be 
      run multiple times, meaning the code only has to be written once as opposed to every time it is needed.
